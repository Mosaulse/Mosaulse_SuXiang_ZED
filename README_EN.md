[Chinese](README.md)

*The color of an antique hand-copied scroll, cast upon your code.*

**Su Xiang** is a pair of VSCode color themes rooted in the aesthetics of ancient Eastern manuscripts.

"Su" (素) is raw, undyed silk — pure and serene; "Xiang" (缃) is the pale amber aged by time — the hue of an old scroll's flyleaf.

No harsh fluorescent whites, no bottomless blacks. Only the warmth of aged paper, the faded ink of settled time, the deliberate impression of a vermillion seal, and the serene jade-green of celadon headings. Like opening an old book in the afternoon sun or by candlelight — every line of code becomes hushed and warm.

> Morning light on paper, the scent of ink fills the room.  
> Keywords like vermillion seals, function names like blue-and-white porcelain.

### Suxiang - Dark (素缃·暮色)

> Dusk falls, candlelight flickers.  
> Ancient pages yellowed, poetry flows.  
> Code becomes verse, its mood lingering.

## 🎨 Four-Symbol Color Palette

This theme follows the traditional Chinese philosophy of the "Four Symbols," building its color system around four classical motifs.

| Symbol | Light Values | Dark Values | Meaning | Role |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|------|
| **Raw Silk** (素绢) | `#F3EAD8` `#E6DCC4` | `#261F16` `#1F1912` | Unfurled silk, aged parchment | Editor & sidebar background |
| **Ink** (墨迹) | `#423729` `#7A6D5E` | `#D0C3AE` `#938A7A` | Year-old ink, verse-like strokes | Foreground text & comments |
| **Vermillion** (朱砂) | `#C54131` `#D96C4A` | `#D95B4A` `#E3947C` | Seal impression, deliberate & solemn | Keywords, numbers, status bar |
| **Jade Green** (青碧) | `#1F987C` `#439D88` | `#7DA494` `#9DBFAD` | Jade motif, warm & serene | Title bar, functions, types |

**Design philosophy:** Raw silk as the ground, ink as the text, vermillion to punctuate, jade green to outline — the spirit of calligraphy, the aesthetics of code.
